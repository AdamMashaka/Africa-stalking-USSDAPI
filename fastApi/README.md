# ðŸ“± USSD Demo Service using FastAPI

This is a simple USSD application demo built with FastAPI.  
It shows developers how to structure multi-level USSD menus (Main Menu, Submenus) and handle user navigation.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Install FastAPI and Uvicorn:

   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn

# ðŸ§  Developer Notes:

### How menu levels work:

| Level            | Meaning                                                |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `text = ""`      | **Main Menu** (no input yet)                           |
| `text = "1"`     | User selected **Option 1** from Main Menu              |
| `text = "2"`     | User selected **Option 2** and waiting to enter amount |
| `text = "2*500"` | User entered amount **500**                            |
| `text = "3"`     | User selected **Option 3** Support Menu                |
| `text = "3*1"`   | User selected **Call Support** inside Support Menu     |
| `text = "3*2"`   | User selected **SMS Support**                          |
| `text = "3*3"`   | User selected **Back to Main Menu**                    |

# ðŸŽ¯ Important:

- Always check **how deep** you are in the `text_array` (how many `*` parts).
- Always use `CON` if you want to **keep user in session**.
- Always use `END` if you want to **end the session** after action.
